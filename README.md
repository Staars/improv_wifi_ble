Improv Wifi - connecting devices to Wi-Fi using Bluetooth LE.

Based on the BLE example for Flutter by Paul DeMarco.

## Getting Started

1. Scan for your BLE device.

2. Connect.

3. Optional the device may provide the need to confirm by user input, like i.e. a button press.

4. Input your WiFi credentials and wait a few seconds.

## Tested
  
This is a multi platform application, that has been successfully tested on macOS and IOS. It should work on all platforms, that are supported by flutter_blu_plus, which is the used bluetooth library.
Confirmed to work on Tasmota devices with custom build and Berry extension.
